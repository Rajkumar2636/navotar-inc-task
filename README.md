Framework:
Serenity BDD (previously known as Thucydides) is a library for test automation which wraps and extends WebDriver/JUnit functionality.

Running the tests:

1). Clone the project into your local.
2). I have used ChromeDriver for Chrome Version (79).Make sure you are using the correct version and update the driver in "libs folder" inside the project if needed.
3). Open command prompt in the project location, Run this command --> "gradlew test clean aggregate". Note use gradle for *nix OS.
4). Open index.html in this path to see the report with screenshots "target\site\serenity\index.html".
